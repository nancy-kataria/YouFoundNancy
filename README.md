# Portfolio Website  

Welcome to my portfolio website, a unique blend of creativity and functionality. This project showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a full-stack developer, presented in a playful yet professional design. This is my first project using Deno and Fresh, marking an exciting learning milestone in my development journey. It uses technologies and tools recommended by [@EthanThatOneKid](https://github.com/EthanThatOneKid).

## üíª Inspiration  

This project is inspired by **command terminals**, a daily part of a coders life. The terminal-like design aims to evoke the power and simplicity of working in a command-line environment, providing a functional yet stylish user interface for developers. It is also inspired by **fake hacking websites**, **Pranx**, **GitHub**, a quote by John Nunemaker, and **the Advent of Code**!
